    <h1>The Job</h1>
    <img src="site%20images/IMG_4590.jpg" alt="office" id="office" class="center">
    <div id="accordion">
        <h3>The Basics</h3>
        <div><p>Firstly, we are an entry level sales and customer service marketing company. What someone would be paid to do is meet with customers, answer any questions they might have, and help them place orders.</p></div>
        <h3>The Pay</h3>
        <div><p>Representatives are paid by commissions, however we also have an Base Pay of $15, which is guaranteed regardless of sales. There are no caps on pay either so you're paid directly on how much you work. Our average reps can expect $300+ in their first week, but those who work hard enough can expect $500+ on their first weekend!</p></div>
        <h3>The Hours</h3>
        <div><p>Our representatives pick and choose their own hours. That way they can balance school, family, friends, and other commitments they may have. We will also help you make time to work more if you desire to do so.</p></div>
        <h3>The Perks</h3>
        <div><p>We operate at an entry level to allow people who don't have experience to gain experience. The skills you learn here are transferable to every other career path you can think of. We recognize those who work hard, we promote those who work hard, and we provide a fun, family environment that is unparalleled.</p></div>
        <h3>Career Opportunities</h3>
        <div><p>For those who advance in our company and choose a career path, they have the option to become a <strong><u>District Manager</u></strong> or a <strong><u>Cutco Sales Professional</u></strong>. District Managers hire, train, and coach a sales force. A CSP would sell CUTCO full time, all year round. </p></div>
