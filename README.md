A website for my employer at Vector Marketing

My client mainly needed the site to be an informational piece for prospective applicants and their parents. The site is supposed to present basic information about our business, what we do, and give an overall feel about the culture we present. Those who already work for Vector could also benefit from the site, so they always have some reference to their titles and who they’re working for. The site could also be beneficial for those who already owned Cutco and needed a reference back to our product website “Cutco.com”. A lot of the company and its background would be discussed in the interview/training and so my client didn’t want all the information on the site. As managers come and go, sales are made, and more pictures are taken, I will update the site with the most accurate form of information possible
